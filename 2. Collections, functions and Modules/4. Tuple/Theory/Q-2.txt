    1. Creating a Tuple :-
        Tuples can be created using parentheses () or by separating values with commas.

    2. Accessing Elements in a Tuple :-
        Just like lists, tuples support indexing.

    3. Slicing a Tuple :-

    4. Tuple Properties
        -> Immutable: Cannot change elements after creation.
        -> Ordered: Maintains the sequence of elements.
        -> Supports indexing and slicing.
        -> Can store mixed data types.
