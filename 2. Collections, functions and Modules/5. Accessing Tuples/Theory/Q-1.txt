Q-1. Accessing tuple elements using positive and negative indexing.

ans:
    1. Positive Indexing :-
        -> Indexes start from 0 for the first element.
        -> Use tuple[index] to access values.

    2. Negative Indexing :-
        -> Negative indexes count from the end.
        -> -1 refers to the last element, -2 to the second last, and so on.
