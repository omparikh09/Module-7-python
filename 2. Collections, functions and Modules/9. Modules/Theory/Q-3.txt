        You can import and use this module in another Python file.

    3. Using from ... import for specific functions :-
        If you need only certain functions from your module.

    4. Adding a __main__ check :-
        If you want to make your module runnable as a standalone script but still usable when imported.

    5. Organizing modules into packages :-
        If you have multiple related modules, you can organize them into a package by creating a folder with an __init__.py file
