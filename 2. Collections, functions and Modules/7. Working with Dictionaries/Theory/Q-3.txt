Q-3. Counting occurrences of characters in a string using dictionaries.

ans:
    1. Using a for Loop :-
        -> This method iterates through the string and updates counts in a dictionary.

        -> get(char, 0) + 1 ensures characters are counted properly without errors.

    2. Using collections.Counter :-
        Pythonâ€™s collections module has a built-in Counter class for counting occurrences.
